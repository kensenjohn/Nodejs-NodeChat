Have read a lot about node.js, so decided to write something.
This project was born out of that curiosity.

Chat Server, uses the TCP sockets to allow telnet (or similar products) to communicate with each other.
Command based application, which does basic functionality such as
a) loging in users
b) keep track of all users
c) sending messages to users
d) allowing users to execute special commands.
e) handling conditions when clients stop using their server.

This is not a complete server. It has not taken into consideration security, hacks, malicious intent of use.
This was built purely for educational reasons.

Am I planning on [perfecting/completing/fixing bugs in] this project?
Nope. Simply because I dont have the time or need for it at this point of time.

Was fun going through the documentation of the nodejs and learning new stuff.

version of nodejs used: 0.4.6
